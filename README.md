# sku_scraping
# Replace 'products.csv' with the path to your input CSV file containing the SKUs.
# Replace 'products_with_description.csv' with the desired name for your output CSV file.
# The script reads the SKUs from the CSV file and stores them in the sku_list.
# For each SKU, it calls the get_product_description function to retrieve the product description and stores it in the descriptions dictionary.
# Finally, it writes the SKU-description pairs to the output CSV file. Each row in the output CSV file will contain the SKU and its corresponding description.
